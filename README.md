# Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases a growing collection of my machine learning projects, ranging from classic ML algorithms to advanced deep learning and applied research. These examples highlight my experience with classification, regression, optimization, neural networks, reinforcement learning, and bioinformatics. Projects are implemented using tools like **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, **LangChain**, and **transformers**.

In addition to individual projects, this repository also references collaborative work such as **SmartStudy** (academic habit optimizer using GPT-4 and TabPFN) and **Cognify AI** (an AI-powered educational assistant for kids built with DeepPiXEL and UTESCA).

### 7. Predicting Disease-Causing Mutations (Bioinformatics Hackathon 2024)
- Developed during a bioinformatics hackathon in Jan 2024  
- Built a machine learning model to predict whether a genetic sequence contains mutations related to **Alzheimerâ€™s disease**, with a focus on **women's health**
- Used genomic mutation data from **DSS NIAGADS** and **GenomeKit**, filtered based on p-values < 0.05  
- Built features using biological mutation transformations, trained a **Random Forest** classifier combined with **Borzoi** from **gReLU** for mutation effect prediction  
- Challenges involved unfamiliarity with genomics and time-limited setup; overcame these through collaboration and rapid research  
- Inspired by the disproportionate impact of Alzheimerâ€™s on women and the shortage of genetic prediction tools  
- Future improvements include increasing accessibility for clinicians and refining mutation localization
